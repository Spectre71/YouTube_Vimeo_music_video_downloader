# YouTube_Vimeo_music_video_downloader
A Python based app for downloading music and videos from YT and Vimeo.

To make an EXE simply follow this procedure:

1. Open terminal (Anaconda, CMD (should work) or another Python compatible solution),
2. Type pip install pyinstaller,
3. Navigate to directory where the app is held and run command pyinstaller your_app.py,
4. It will generate a dir named "dist" in the same dir you had your .py app in,
5. Run app.

# ATTENTION:

The app is not complete. Core functionality is in place, but we intend to overhaul it visually and add functionality as required. A port for Android and iOS is also under way. Stay tuned, stay safe and stay connected.

Cheers!
