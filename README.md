# YouTube_Vimeo_music_video_downloader
A Python based app for downloading music and videos from YT and Vimeo.

To make an EXE simply follow this procedure:

1. Open terminal (Anaconda, CMD (should work) or another Python compatible solution),
2. Type or cp-p w/o quotation marks: "pip install pyinstaller tkinter pytube moviepy" (meaning the ones you reqire or don't have),
3. Through terminal, navigate to directory where the app is held and run command pyinstaller your_app.py,
4. It will generate a dir named "dist" in the same dir you had your .py app in,
5. Run app.

6. Lastly, you may find this thread helpfull in case you run into trouble: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5458048/how-can-i-make-a-python-script-standalone-executable-to-run-without-any-dependen.

# ATTENTION:

The app is not complete. Core functionality is in place, but we intend to overhaul it visually and add functionality as required. A port for Android and iOS is also under way. Stay tuned, stay safe and stay connected.

Cheers!
