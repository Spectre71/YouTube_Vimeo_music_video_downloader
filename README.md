# YouTube_Vimeo_music_video_downloader
A Python based app for downloading music and videos from YT and Vimeo.

To make an EXE simply follow this procedure:

1. Open terminal (Anaconda, CMD (should work) or another Python compatible solution),
2. Type or cp-p w/o quotation marks: "pip install pyinstaller tkinter pytube moviepy" (meaning the ones you require or don't have),
3. Through terminal, navigate to directory where the app is held and run command pyinstaller your_app.py,
4. It will generate a dir named "dist" in the same dir you had your .py app in,
5. Run app.

# ATTENTION:

The app is not complete. Core functionality is in place, but we intend to overhaul it visually and add functionality as required. A port for Android and iOS is also under way. Stay tuned, stay safe and stay connected.

# Roadmap:

1. Add ability to download 18+ restricted videos and music from YT **(DONE)**,
2. Add video thumbnail showcase **(DONE)**,
3. Make handling of exceptions smoother and stabilize the app not to crash in such cases,
4. optimize code (redundant code removal),
5. update GUI for PC version,
6. optimize code for Android and iOS ports,
7. Linux port.

Cheers!
